# I Just Want To Hear Your Voice

Yeah, I used to be big into Vocaloid, back into the day.

Anyway. This site is an experimentation with i18n, where `en` is English (i.e. the real language) and `de` isn't German, but a fake almost language.

IDEALLY, I'd like to have `ip_NI` (Niman) as the "localisation", but in the interest of getting it working now and fixing later...
